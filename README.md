# Machine-Learning
Solutions to Andrew Ng's machine learning course (Coursera)

This repo contains all the take-home assignments given from the Coursera Machine Learning classes.
The scripts are in MATLAB and all of the solutions are original and passed the final examination.

Contact me if you found this repo (hmmm, you got lucky!) and then have any question.
